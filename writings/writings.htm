<p class="Style2"> <a name="memoirs"></a>Memoirs of a Ufologist</p>
<p> by John Hoppy Hopkins &lt;fantasyfactory@homecall.co.uk&gt;</p>
<p> UFO was the first psychedelic night club in England. We had the new talent to die for &amp; then scored a truly great location. For a few months in 1967 it was the main social meeting place of the 'underground' counter culture, a basement Irish dance hall with a sprung floor in London's Tottenham Court Road otherwise known as the Blarney Club. For us it performed the function of both a &ldquo;gentlemens club&rdquo; &amp; a cubbers dance club. UFO was a Friday allnighter from 10pm till the first tubes ran around 6 in the morning, conveniently about the length of an acid trip. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Halfway down the wide entrance stairs we put a snow machine, a theatre light producing the effect of continuously falling snow. Stand in it for a minute or 2 and you begin to be disoriented - the same as driving a car into a snowstorm &ndash; definitely hypnotic. At the bottom of the steps was the pay desk &ndash; see below. As the steps were really wide people would sit safely on them when cooling down or chilling out.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Add to that a whiff of incense and by the time you reached the bottom the atmosphere was set, with music drifting out as the people drifted in. In those days to run a club the people had to be members, so there was a table and a card index and a couple of staff taking the money and issuing cards, and no security to speak of &ndash; certainly an absence of government licensed thugs posing as weightlifters while also running a handy &amp; profitable substance recycling operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Once inside, apart from a small office and a cloak room, you were basically in one large basement space, a hall big enough to hold a few hundred people, with a low stage and a ceiling fan or two. Larger &amp; Of course, we imported our own extra decor and dimmed the lights, the idea being to create a warm and friendly atmosphere. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Usually a couple of bands were featured, each doing 1 or 2 sets. Sometimes a band member would read a poem or other stuff depending on the vibe in the club and the politics of the street that week. Often curious musicians from other bands playing in the West End would drop by around 3am to listen &amp; occasionally jam in UFO.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> That doesn&rsquo;t take up 8 hours, so in between there were records &ndash; LPs &ndash; but no DJs with massive ego's -- they were not on stage -- and no bone shaking PA system so earplugs were not required. There were 4 upright WEM speakers on stands in the 4 corners of the space, giving exaggerated separation of the stereo image. Whoever was putting on the records would often play a whole side complete with the gaps between tracks. This enabled conversations to happen without having to shout at each other. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Towards morning a peripatetic musician or two, sax player &amp; drummer, would wander around the dance floor, stepping over the reclining bodies. This interaction helped soften the distinction between the musicians / performance and the audience. Or again, someone might distribute flyers for a gig or a demo in the coming days.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Artists had their place too. One time Yoko Ono was making her film &ldquo;Bottoms&rdquo; which required lots of people one by one removing their trousers, knickers, etc and walking on a revolving table while Yoko filmed their arse in closeup. This was done in a nearby hotel room while volunteers from UFO were ferried back and forth in the middle of the night. This unlikely epic was subsequently shown in the West End. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> When I T got busted on obscenity charges, UFO was the starting point of a free speech demo that consisted of poet Harry Fainlight in a coffiin being carried by a motley crowd of tripping UFO goers, down Whitehall past the Cenotaph (outraged Sunday Mirror), then down Westminster tube to emerge hours later, after several circuits of the Circle line, in Notting Hill to be resurrected in Portobello Rd.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> When the Stones got busted that summer, UFO was rallying point for people from different west end clubs who then demonstrated in Fleet St &amp; held up the distribution of the News of the Screws for some hours. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Lightshows &amp; Projections. As well as the regular lightshow providers, among whom Mark Boyle &amp; Joan Hills (now the Boyle Family), Jack Bracelin (he ran a nudist camp out Watford way), Jo Gannon (a very bright teenager who subsequently produced the Mary Tyler Moore US TVshow) and Dermot Harvey (an errant biochemist, discoverer of many immiscible liquids) there were other projections. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> One almost forgotten favorite was Chinese animation movies hired on 16mm film from Contemporary Films - shown silent &amp; projected on the walls rather than the white curtain across the stage that we also used between sets. The audio could be something quite different. The detail was ravishing to the tripping eye. The scaffolding projection tower was strategically placed so that projectors could be occasionally swung round causing the watchers to move round to continue watching &ndash; a subtle way to keep people moving.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Density of people. This is one parameter that has always fascinated me. A promoter's natural wish is to have as many punters as possible in their club, its good business. But the more there are the more it gets crowded until you reach a point where the popularity destroys the very thing you had in the first place, a good social &amp; dancing space. This is a constant dilemma and our only solution was to go to a bigger venue, but the change of scale had other consequences and the scene got too heavy with ripoffs that eventually closed the club down. It lasted just 9 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> In the analogue age there were many variations on the club theme and UFO was just one of them. We tried to keep alive the spirit of the Happening which purposely injects uncertainty into the event, which seemed to fit with the experimental zeitgeist. Mixing different sensory inputs was certainly fun and it didnt always work out. But one essential was always kept in mind, to keep an overview of whatever was going on and to be sensitive to the vibe going down. That way there were never any fights and hardly any bad scenes even when someone freaked out and had to be led away and talked down.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> In the digital age there has been a convergence of technology, meaning that computers + projectors are almost universally used for image delivery. Paradoxically this often reduces the variety of visual input. Lights are computer controlled by already finished programs, which can completely remove the interactivity that was possible with systems with more elements of manual control.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> The opportunity to knit together different music tracks seamlessly &amp; beat-matched can't be resisted, and this in turn produces really long sets of continuous sound, mostly at a high volume. The upside is that, at best, dance alone induces trance, and a room full of tranced out people is something only possible in the digital age - the technology drives the experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> I look forward to finding out what today's experimenters are producing at Futuresonic, mercilessly plundering the past and the present to produce the future. </p>

  Tribute to Nicholas Albery 1948-2001-</font></p>
<p class="caract"><br>
  Nicholas was one of the main developers of UK conterculture, taking the ideas 
  of the 60's and living them through for the next 30 years. His 18-minute video 
  &quot;From beyond the grave&quot; recorded a few months before his death in 
  a car accident, is an extraordinary communication to the people of the present 
  and the near future. [<a href="mailto:rhino@dial.pipex.com">rhino@dial.pipex.com</a>]

<p class="caract"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><a name="obituary"></a>Obituary: 
  published in <i>The Independent</i></font></p>
<p class="caract">Founder and principal officer of the Institute for Social Inventions, 
  Nicholas Albery was an innovative generalist widely respected, not only for 
  having learned how to brainstorm himself and others to solve problems and produce 
  new ideas, but also for testing and living them out.</p>
<p class="caract">Among the illustrious supporters of the Institute are Lord Beaumont, 
  Sir Richard Boddy, Edward Goldsmith, Brian Eno, Anita Roddick, Fay Weldon, Sir 
  Peter Parker, Linne Franks, Colin Wilson, Stafford Beer, Lord Young of Dartington, 
  Diane the wife of Ernst &quot;small is beautiful&quot; Schumacher.</p>
<p class="caract">The breadth of his thinking and the scope of his output was 
  extraordinary. From the Global Ideas Bank (as he put it &quot;the website of 
  the Institute, it has extended this collecting of ideas to the Internet, with 
  millions accessing the site every year&quot;) to the Natural Death Centre (&quot;advising 
  those wishing to organise green, inexpensive family-based funerals&quot;); from 
  the International Poetry Challenge Day (&quot;individuals and schools take up 
  the challenge to learn poems by heart to raise money for charity&quot;) to the 
  Apprentice-Master Alliance (&quot;a free service that links graduates or school-leavers 
  wishing to learn a trade with small or one person businesses for long-term apprenticeships&quot;), 
  Nicholas has left his mark on society in a way that, in buddhist terminology, 
  represents &quot;the creation of merit for the benefit of all beings&quot;, 
  although not a buddhist himself.</p>
<p class="caract">Nicholas was the collaborator, or catalyst, par excellence. 
  He rarely claimed innovations as his own. Having realised early on in his life 
  that information could be free and not withheld or possessed for some people 
  to gain advantage over others, he then set about carrying this principle out 
  with an almost manic energy.</p>
<p class="caract">His publications include The Book of Visions-an encyclopaedia 
  of social innovations, Virgin, 1993; Poem for the Day, Chatto, 1994; Time Out 
  Book of Country Walks, Penguin, 1997; Seize the Day (forthcoming), 2001. An 
  Internet search for &quot;Nicholas Albery&quot; yields about 1850 items. </p>
<p class="caract">Born in 1948, he was one of 4 siblings in the theatre-land dynasty 
  headed by Sir Donald Albery. Public school educated and an Oxford University 
  dropout, he was equally a child of the optimistic sixties who never lost his 
  early vision of the role that information could play in a society where computers 
  are widespread. But rather than being a techno-nerd, he was interested in the 
  social uses of information. In this sense he was a generation ahead of most 
  of his peers in envisaging, in the late sixties, the socially beneficial uses 
  of what has now become the Internet.</p>
<p class="caract">At age 19 Nicholas lived on complan for a year because he wanted 
  to test its claim to be a compete food. At 29 he was a leading light of the 
  Free Republic of Frestonia, an area of Notting Hill that declared itself independent 
  of the UK in order to resist evictions and subsequent commercial development 
  (they won). At 30 he stood as Ecology Party candidate in Kensington &amp; Chelsea 
  and got 800 votes, including the ballot paper marked with a heart instead of 
  a cross which after lengthy debate was accepted as valid as it clearly expressed 
  the voter's intent.</p>
<p class="caract">In the late 60's he ran BIT, the London-based alternative information 
  service. In between finding crash pads and temporary work for allcomers he produced 
  the first overland guide to India, complied from travellers tales. A cover of 
  BITMAN magazine in the mid-70's shows him and Nicholas Saunders (the Neal's 
  Yard/Covent Garden entrepreneur) walking naked down Piccadilly captioned &quot;rehearsal 
  for the year 2000&quot;.</p>
<p class="caract">The collaboration of the two Nicholases, Saunders and Albery, 
  became the pivot for a raft of social innovations for the next quarter century; 
  Albery as the socially involved ideas man who stayed up all hours with the computer 
  as well as running a highly varied open-plan social life, Saunders as the entrepreneur 
  risk-taker with the Midas touch. Sadly, each of them died in a freak car crash 
  where the other passengers were unscathed, Saunders in 1998, Albery this past 
  weekend.</p>
<p class="caract">To his friends he was supportive and showed great generosity 
  and loving-kindness. For friends and strangers alike, he brought a sense of 
  excitement to every occasion, challenging, always asking questions that got 
  to the heart of the situation, and spilling over with ideas.</p>
<p class="caract">But perhaps his greatest contribution is as a role model for 
  how to behave in our information-dense, technology-based society: trying to 
  be inclusive not exclusive, always curious but not accepting the given as fixed 
  or immutable, putting people before machines. The website www.globalideasbank.org 
  is exemplary. When asked what one needs to become a social inventor he replied 
  &quot;a mentor who believes in you; to have run an enterprise when quite young; 
  to be an artist with a creative mind&quot;.</p>
<p class="caract">His interest in country walks, which he managed to do once a 
  week for many years, dates from his being diagnosed with the potentially crippling 
  disease ankylosing spondylitis which tends to weld one's vertebrae together. 
  Characteristically his response was to take a large amount of exercise to combat 
  the problem head-on, and although he was no athlete he retained a glow of youth 
  that eludes most of us in middle age. Unusually, he looked no younger in death 
  than when alive. </p>

<p class="caract"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><a name="thoughts"></a>Thoughts 
  following Nicholas's burial</font></p>
<p class="caract">Several people told me at the burial that before hearing of 
  Nicholas's death but after it had happened, they had disturbing dreams, feelings 
  or premonitions that something was wrong. As if there were a tug on a non-physical 
  level between Nicholas and themselves.</p>
<p class="caract">I have experienced similar tugs several times in my life (though 
  not from Nicholas), and I think that there are psychic or spiritual links between 
  us that occasionally show themselves like this in moments of crisis, or sometimes 
  of deep joy. Together they form a skein, invisible but no less real.</p>
<p class="caract">At funerals or burials when groups of us come together to enact 
  the rite of passage, it is a special occasion for all of us. Yesterday that 
  silent walk in the woods behind the coffin where you could feel and hear the 
  soft footsteps on the woody path, and hear the birdsong filtering through the 
  trees from the meadow. Or when we gathered in the meadow and people talked to 
  the group about Nicholas. Or when the graveside words were over and we each 
  scattered our piece of earth onto the lowered flower-covered coffin, the physical 
  finality.</p>
<p class="caract">These are occasions when the links are strengthened or formed 
  afresh, the invisible skein that holds us together and that we ourselves will 
  pull on in moments of special joy, sadness, or when the time comes finally to 
  split.</p>
<p class="caract">In certain Buddhist schools of thought, death is a drawn-out 
  event that starts at the moment of the body's death and takes about 7 weeks 
  for the dissolution of the spirit to be complete - followed by reincarnation 
  of the life force (and very rarely, of the personality).</p>
<p class="caract">In Nicholas's case, the burial was on the 14th day of death 
  and his spirit still has another 5 weeks to complete its departure and return 
  to the void. That's why the thoughts, good wishes, prayers, whatever, directed 
  toward him are so important, because they may yet be able to help his spirit 
  pass on. </p>
<p class="caract">And in case this provokes in you ideas of superstition, take 
  only what has meaning for the living: that the skein that holds us all together 
  has been strengthened once more. <br>
