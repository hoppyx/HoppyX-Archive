  Tribute to Nicholas Albery 1948-2001-</font></p>
<p class="caract"><br>
  Nicholas was one of the main developers of UK conterculture, taking the ideas 
  of the 60's and living them through for the next 30 years. His 18-minute video 
  &quot;From beyond the grave&quot; recorded a few months before his death in 
  a car accident, is an extraordinary communication to the people of the present 
  and the near future. [<a href="mailto:rhino@dial.pipex.com">rhino@dial.pipex.com</a>]

<p class="caract"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FFFFFF"><a name="obituary"></a>Obituary: 
  published in <i>The Independent</i></font></p>
<p class="caract">Founder and principal officer of the Institute for Social Inventions, 
  Nicholas Albery was an innovative generalist widely respected, not only for 
  having learned how to brainstorm himself and others to solve problems and produce 
  new ideas, but also for testing and living them out.</p>
<p class="caract">Among the illustrious supporters of the Institute are Lord Beaumont, 
  Sir Richard Boddy, Edward Goldsmith, Brian Eno, Anita Roddick, Fay Weldon, Sir 
  Peter Parker, Linne Franks, Colin Wilson, Stafford Beer, Lord Young of Dartington, 
  Diane the wife of Ernst &quot;small is beautiful&quot; Schumacher.</p>
<p class="caract">The breadth of his thinking and the scope of his output was 
  extraordinary. From the Global Ideas Bank (as he put it &quot;the website of 
  the Institute, it has extended this collecting of ideas to the Internet, with 
  millions accessing the site every year&quot;) to the Natural Death Centre (&quot;advising 
  those wishing to organise green, inexpensive family-based funerals&quot;); from 
  the International Poetry Challenge Day (&quot;individuals and schools take up 
  the challenge to learn poems by heart to raise money for charity&quot;) to the 
  Apprentice-Master Alliance (&quot;a free service that links graduates or school-leavers 
  wishing to learn a trade with small or one person businesses for long-term apprenticeships&quot;), 
  Nicholas has left his mark on society in a way that, in buddhist terminology, 
  represents &quot;the creation of merit for the benefit of all beings&quot;, 
  although not a buddhist himself.</p>
<p class="caract">Nicholas was the collaborator, or catalyst, par excellence. 
  He rarely claimed innovations as his own. Having realised early on in his life 
  that information could be free and not withheld or possessed for some people 
  to gain advantage over others, he then set about carrying this principle out 
  with an almost manic energy.</p>
<p class="caract">His publications include The Book of Visions-an encyclopaedia 
  of social innovations, Virgin, 1993; Poem for the Day, Chatto, 1994; Time Out 
  Book of Country Walks, Penguin, 1997; Seize the Day (forthcoming), 2001. An 
  Internet search for &quot;Nicholas Albery&quot; yields about 1850 items. </p>
<p class="caract">Born in 1948, he was one of 4 siblings in the theatre-land dynasty 
  headed by Sir Donald Albery. Public school educated and an Oxford University 
  dropout, he was equally a child of the optimistic sixties who never lost his 
  early vision of the role that information could play in a society where computers 
  are widespread. But rather than being a techno-nerd, he was interested in the 
  social uses of information. In this sense he was a generation ahead of most 
  of his peers in envisaging, in the late sixties, the socially beneficial uses 
  of what has now become the Internet.</p>
<p class="caract">At age 19 Nicholas lived on complan for a year because he wanted 
  to test its claim to be a compete food. At 29 he was a leading light of the 
  Free Republic of Frestonia, an area of Notting Hill that declared itself independent 
  of the UK in order to resist evictions and subsequent commercial development 
  (they won). At 30 he stood as Ecology Party candidate in Kensington &amp; Chelsea 
  and got 800 votes, including the ballot paper marked with a heart instead of 
  a cross which after lengthy debate was accepted as valid as it clearly expressed 
  the voter's intent.</p>
<p class="caract">In the late 60's he ran BIT, the London-based alternative information 
  service. In between finding crash pads and temporary work for allcomers he produced 
  the first overland guide to India, complied from travellers tales. A cover of 
  BITMAN magazine in the mid-70's shows him and Nicholas Saunders (the Neal's 
  Yard/Covent Garden entrepreneur) walking naked down Piccadilly captioned &quot;rehearsal 
  for the year 2000&quot;.</p>
<p class="caract">The collaboration of the two Nicholases, Saunders and Albery, 
  became the pivot for a raft of social innovations for the next quarter century; 
  Albery as the socially involved ideas man who stayed up all hours with the computer 
  as well as running a highly varied open-plan social life, Saunders as the entrepreneur 
  risk-taker with the Midas touch. Sadly, each of them died in a freak car crash 
  where the other passengers were unscathed, Saunders in 1998, Albery this past 
  weekend.</p>
<p class="caract">To his friends he was supportive and showed great generosity 
  and loving-kindness. For friends and strangers alike, he brought a sense of 
  excitement to every occasion, challenging, always asking questions that got 
  to the heart of the situation, and spilling over with ideas.</p>
<p class="caract">But perhaps his greatest contribution is as a role model for 
  how to behave in our information-dense, technology-based society: trying to 
  be inclusive not exclusive, always curious but not accepting the given as fixed 
  or immutable, putting people before machines. The website www.globalideasbank.org 
  is exemplary. When asked what one needs to become a social inventor he replied 
  &quot;a mentor who believes in you; to have run an enterprise when quite young; 
  to be an artist with a creative mind&quot;.</p>
<p class="caract">His interest in country walks, which he managed to do once a 
  week for many years, dates from his being diagnosed with the potentially crippling 
  disease ankylosing spondylitis which tends to weld one's vertebrae together. 
  Characteristically his response was to take a large amount of exercise to combat 
  the problem head-on, and although he was no athlete he retained a glow of youth 
  that eludes most of us in middle age. Unusually, he looked no younger in death 
  than when alive. </p>

<p class="caract"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><a name="thoughts"></a>Thoughts 
  following Nicholas's burial</font></p>
<p class="caract">Several people told me at the burial that before hearing of 
  Nicholas's death but after it had happened, they had disturbing dreams, feelings 
  or premonitions that something was wrong. As if there were a tug on a non-physical 
  level between Nicholas and themselves.</p>
<p class="caract">I have experienced similar tugs several times in my life (though 
  not from Nicholas), and I think that there are psychic or spiritual links between 
  us that occasionally show themselves like this in moments of crisis, or sometimes 
  of deep joy. Together they form a skein, invisible but no less real.</p>
<p class="caract">At funerals or burials when groups of us come together to enact 
  the rite of passage, it is a special occasion for all of us. Yesterday that 
  silent walk in the woods behind the coffin where you could feel and hear the 
  soft footsteps on the woody path, and hear the birdsong filtering through the 
  trees from the meadow. Or when we gathered in the meadow and people talked to 
  the group about Nicholas. Or when the graveside words were over and we each 
  scattered our piece of earth onto the lowered flower-covered coffin, the physical 
  finality.</p>
<p class="caract">These are occasions when the links are strengthened or formed 
  afresh, the invisible skein that holds us together and that we ourselves will 
  pull on in moments of special joy, sadness, or when the time comes finally to 
  split.</p>
<p class="caract">In certain Buddhist schools of thought, death is a drawn-out 
  event that starts at the moment of the body's death and takes about 7 weeks 
  for the dissolution of the spirit to be complete - followed by reincarnation 
  of the life force (and very rarely, of the personality).</p>
<p class="caract">In Nicholas's case, the burial was on the 14th day of death 
  and his spirit still has another 5 weeks to complete its departure and return 
  to the void. That's why the thoughts, good wishes, prayers, whatever, directed 
  toward him are so important, because they may yet be able to help his spirit 
  pass on. </p>
<p class="caract">And in case this provokes in you ideas of superstition, take 
  only what has meaning for the living: that the skein that holds us all together 
  has been strengthened once more. <br>
